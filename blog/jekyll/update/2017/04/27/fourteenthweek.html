    <p><strong>What did you do this past week?</strong></p>

<p>This past week has been pretty light. Not much homework and not much to do in general. Since finishing IDB phase3 last week, this past week was pretty light in terms of working for this class. For my other classes, I just did homework and waiting for the storm to hit next week with all my finals. I did drink a lot of coffee this past week for no reason and I may have caught a cold. If I were to summarize my past week, it would be the calm before the storm.</p>

<p><strong>What’s in your way?</strong></p>

<p>Mostly finishing up my last set of homeworks for my classes ranging from math to quantum to my intro to security class. I do have to study a lot for two of my classes, this one and security, for my final exams on Thursday. It’s unfortunate both are on the same day and I do not feel confident in either of the classes.</p>

<p><strong>What will you do next week?</strong></p>

<p>Cram cram cram. I imagine that I will be cramming for both of my tests in the next few days. However, tomorrow I’m going to try the famous Snow’s bbq and getting with my group to finish the presentation. Also, I’ll be seeing Phantom of the Opera a the Bass concert hall and I’m pretty excited about that.</p>

<p><strong>What’s my experience of the class?</strong></p>

<p>A lot of studying. Looking back on the second half, I noticed that there’s a lot of material for me to go over before the exam. The first exam mostly covered python materials and I was familiar with the language so it wasn’t that bad, but this half might be quite a challenge considering the last few quizzes were incredibly difficult for me. Presentations are fun! Team and I can’t wait to share wha we accomplished and see what other teams have made.</p>

<p><strong>What’s my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong></p>

<p>Use Ycombinator’s website to find jobs. Surprisingly, the simple website contains a lot of information such as jobs, tech news and interesting github repos. Strongly recommend everyone to browse it when they’re bored and see if they can find anything interesting or learn something.</p>
