    <p><strong>What did you do this past week?</strong></p>

<p>This week things finally started to pick up for my classes. A lot of my activities centered around school. I thought taking 13 hours would be easy but it looks like it’s going to be a rough semester with the amount of work I’ll have to do for each class. Besides that, my roommates and I finally got our Wii working so we’ve spent several nights just goofing around and playing games. Furthermore, we watched Shutter Island, which we all agreed was a video mind twisting movie.</p>

<p><strong>What’s in your way?</strong></p>

<p>Currently, I need to finish my quantum homework. I need to also refresh my linear algebra skills for it too. In addition, I have to learn how to do synchronization for Java so I can do my homework for my intro to security class.</p>

<p><strong>What will you do next week?</strong></p>

<p>Next week, I think my roommates and I will do a Bollywood night. In addition to drudging through my work load, I might start doing more readings so I can acquaint myself more with the world around me. And I think next Saturday, I will be attending a music concert which I’m greatly excited about.</p>

<p><strong>What’s my experience of the class?</strong></p>

<p>Collatz is over! The class is still going very well. Some of the quizzes are becoming more challenging but I think the materials we cover are very relevant to what a work place would be like. Workflow was a pain in the butt for the first assignment but I thought the entirety of was still useful in providing us a guide. I really appreciate the fast Piazza responses the instructors give and the good advices that they provide whenever an opportunity comes up.</p>

<p><strong>What’s my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong></p>

<p>Sharelatex! I used to do almost all of my work by writing it on a piece of paper. But with more math classes, I’ve learned to use Latex for the work. Instead of installing all the packages, you can easily use Latex through a website called Sharelatex. It allows easy and fast modifications along with providing auto complete and suggestions for what you type.</p>
