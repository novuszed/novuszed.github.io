    <p><strong>What did you do this past week?</strong></p>

<p>This past week I got obliterated on my math midterm. It is worse than it sounds because the professor walked in and told us it is an easy test and then the test demolished me. Other than that, I did pretty horribly on all the quizzes for this class probably from the lack of time to study. Besides that, I had to finish homework for math and start doing my quantum homework for my quantum computing class. We did cover interesting algorithms this week regarding Shor’s algorithm and Grover’s algorithm. Other than that, it was just a lot of studying.</p>

<p><strong>What’s in your way?</strong></p>

<p>Microsoft puzzle challenge! Tomorrow I will be attending the Microsoft Puzzle challenge with my team. It’s an all day event in which teams from all over the country work together to solve puzzles. The puzzles are difficult so we don’t really have high hopes going into it. In addition, I must finish up my homework for my classes and proceed to organize what I have to do for the following weeks.</p>

<p><strong>What will you do next week?</strong></p>

<p>Next week I think my team and I for this class will start doing phase3 of the IDB project. In addition, I’m assuming that I will be assigned more quantum homework so I’ll have to do that. Maybe next weekend, I will drive around Austin and explore it if time permits. Maybe I will go rock climbing, that sounds pretty fun and good way to rid stress.</p>

<p><strong>What’s my experience of the class?</strong></p>

<p>Interesting but difficult. While I do appreciate talking about SQL in class, it does take a while to get used to all the different aspects of it. In addition, the readings for this class is pretty long and the refactoring book is rather dry to read. Phase2 went better than phase1 but I think phase 3 will be quite challenging. I really enjoyed how we were allowed to stop class before 11:50 so the groups can get together and talk about it. This allowed my group and I to communicate more in person.</p>

<p><strong>What’s my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong></p>

<p>https://oeis.org/
This week i stumbled upon this nice website that allows you to find formulas that calculate a certain sequence of numbers. It provides a basic explaination along with other peculiar facts about the sequence of numbers provided. It also comes in different languages. It’s pretty fun tool to use if you enjoy sequences of numbers and finding what’s special about them.</p>
