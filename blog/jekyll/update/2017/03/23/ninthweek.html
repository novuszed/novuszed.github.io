    <p><strong>What did you do this past week?</strong></p>

<p>This week was the week of CS373 group project. Having just gotten done with the break, we realized that we didn’t really make any great strides in our project during the break. Nor did we the week before that because of the exam. So having gotten back on Monday, we decided to meet and work on it. In the beginning, we didn’t really know how much we had to do but after taking a closer look at the project we realized that we were in for the ride of our life. So since that Monday until the Thursday nignt when the project was due, my team and I went absolutely crazy every single day trying to finish and understand the project. After countless hours and late nights, we managed to pull it off to the best of our ability and I think we were all pretty satisfied in the end.</p>

<p><strong>What’s in your way?</strong></p>

<p>Studying for my math test that will be coming up in a week and doing my quantum homework for next week. Also patiently waiting for phase 2 of the SWE project so we can get started earlier this phase and finish it. Other than that, I have to drive back to San Antonio with a friend so she can make it to her MCAT testing.</p>

<p><strong>What will you do next week?</strong></p>

<p>Finishing up homework and studying mostly. Maybe even help out my Dad with finishing up our house in San Antonio so we can put it up for sale soon. Seems like it’ll be a pretty laid back week, hopefully I’ll have more time to read.</p>

<p><strong>What’s my experience of the class?</strong></p>

<p>I thought the project description for phase I was very confusing and it took a long time for us to understand what was expected. Particularly there were some typos in the project that confused us and it wasn’t resolved until we spoke with a TA. Other than that, I think the class is going well. I’m happy that we’re getting into SQL soon. Since I’ve never taken any database class, I feel this will be a good opportunity for me to learn and familiarize myself with it so we can do the backend in an efficient way.</p>

<p><strong>What’s my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
