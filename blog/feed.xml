&lt;p&gt;This past week I was assigned project 1 for this class along with homework for my quantum information class. I finished project 1 and I’m currenctly struggling through quantum information. I realized how terrible I am in linear algebra but I’m lucky that I have roommates who are willing to help me. Besides that, school has been fine. Wednesday night, my friends and I went out for dinner to send away one of our friends to Europe. And soon, I will be doing some tedious driving back and forth to celebrate Chinese New Year with my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s in your way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, I just have my quantum homework in my way. Besides that, I need to do a lot of reading for my math classes so I don’t fall behind. Trying to juggle school and fun will be a challenge this semester. In addition, I’m trying to be more healthy and hope to have time to exercise this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will you do next week?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, I will have to finish my homework and drudge through another week in my classes. It’ll basically be a lot of reading and learning outside of class and occasionally go out with friends to enjoy the semester. I hope to go on an adventure next week and explore nature and do something different than I have done before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s my experience of the class?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After working on project 1, I’m beginning to love the class more and more. The entire work flow felt like an actual software development experience and I am glad that I could learn the tools needed. I feel like this class will greatly prepare me for the real world and I can’t wait to see what’s in stored for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After struggling through my math classes, I discovered the wonderful tool called Mathematica. Mathematica is a math-centric programming language. It allows you to easily manipulate math and solve equations and provide visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">What did you do this past week?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">First week of classes</title><link href="http://zihaozhu.me/blog/jekyll/update/2017/01/22/post1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="First week of classes" /><published>2017-01-22T03:32:54-06:00</published><updated>2017-01-22T03:32:54-06:00</updated><id>http://zihaozhu.me/blog/jekyll/update/2017/01/22/post1</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://zihaozhu.me/blog/jekyll/update/2017/01/22/post1.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did you do this past week?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past week was the beginning of the new semester. A lot of my time was spent on trying to figure out scheduling for my classes and trying to petition into the classes I wanted to. Unfortunately, after hours of constantly refreshing my waitlist page and the course schedule, I wasn’t able to get into some of the honor classes I hoped to. Like a good student, I attended all my classes and I think this will be a good semester. Everything I’m learning seems to be very interesting and I’m excited to see what I will be able to pick up in my quantum mechanics class. Other than school, my roommates and I watched a lot of TV and went and explored various parts of North Austin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s in your way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to frantically see if I can do a late-add for a CS class I want to take. I should probably reorganize my desk and have a calendar that tracks my daily work and plan my weeks out ahead. There’s some homework that was assigned for 2 of my classes so I should probably get on those to make sure I’m not behind in the beginning of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will you do next week?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, I will try to finalize my course schedule and slowly settle into the semester. Then on Friday, I will drive to San Antonio and then to Houston to spend the weekend celebrating Chinese New Year with my parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s my experience of the class?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I find this class really engaging and insightful. It goes into so many tiny details of software engineering and helps describe a lot of tools that I think I will use in the future. While I have some experience with Python, I really enjoyed how we went over line by line of the syntax and some nuances of Python that I didn’t look into before. The fact that the class feels like a conversation helps me retain the information better and keeps me more focused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use Jekyll for your blogs! I discovered the power of Jekyll while creating this blog and realized how nice the static generator site came out. Jekyll seems to be very easy to use with minimum knowledge needed for the Ruby parts, high recommend anyone to read the documentation and try it on their own https://jekyllrb.com/.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">What did you do this past week?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome to Jekyll!</title><link href="http://zihaozhu.me/blog/jekyll/update/2017/01/22/welcome-to-jekyll.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to Jekyll!" /><published>2017-01-22T03:32:54-06:00</published><updated>2017-01-22T03:32:54-06:00</updated><id>http://zihaozhu.me/blog/jekyll/update/2017/01/22/welcome-to-jekyll</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://zihaozhu.me/blog/jekyll/update/2017/01/22/welcome-to-jekyll.html">&lt;p&gt;Anurag wuz here. You’ll find this post in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
