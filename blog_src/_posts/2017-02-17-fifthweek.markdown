**What did you do this past week?**

This week was spent mostly on finishing Netflix for this class and working on quantum homework for my other class. Netflix took a while because there were many requirements that we needed to fulfill. In addition, it took us a while to come up with a way to get the RMSE under 0.95. Other than that, it's been a pretty mundane week. I wish I had gone to career fair but due to classes I couldnt't. In addition, Valentine's day was pretty average too, nothing spectucular. Other than that, I had friends over for some nights and we just hung out and ate. 

**What's in your way?**

Quantum homework. The bane of my semester. Don't get me wrong, it is a great class but does require a lot of work if physics does not come intuitively. Other than that, I need to finish my Scientific computation homework and study for the test that I'll be taking next Thursday. Then there are just a bunch of little assignments I need to fulfill such as my python homework and readings for this class. There are many small hurdles but I think I will be able to handle them and enjoy my weekend.

**What will you do next week?**

Next week, I plan on attending the competitive programming competition on Friday and then go over to a friend's house over the weekend. I don't think anything interesting will happen, but I'm excited to take on the week as we inch closer to spring break. I also plan on studying a lot for my math test and hopefully do well on it. 

**What's my experience of the class?**

Netflix project looked very easy in the beginning but towards the end I realized we had made a mistake in allowing ratings between 0 and 1 so we had to do some last minute changes and resulted in submitting the assignment late. The projects often have many details in them so it's easy to miss a thing here and there. Overall, I really enjoy the class. We're diving into Python deeper and deeper and sometimes I have to spend time outside of class to make sure I understand the various features Python has to offer and how certain methods act the way they do. I'm looking forward to the group projects!

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

Atom editor! If you're not a Vim or Emac wiz and you're too poor to afford Sublime, you should try Atom! Atom editor has a lot of features installed and you have the opportunity to download a lot of plug-ins such as auto complete to make your life easier as a programmer. It's versatile in that you can program in many different languages and it has a strong community supported by many.
