**What did you do this past week?**

This past week was filled with pain and agony as I struggled through my first midterm and the competitive programming competition on Friday. Having been out of the testing psyche since last semester, this first test was something I was quite concerned about. I spent the majority of time trying to memorize the formulas I'll be needing but I still felt defeated after the exam. In addition, I learned about quantum teleportation. So hopefully one day I'll be able to teleport myself into another world.

Fun thing that did happen was that my roommates and I almost burned down our apartment from a cooking accident. Despite that, the food turned out great!

**What's in your way?**

Yet again, a weekend of quantum information homework fun! Furthermore, I am trying to wrap up some school projects before I head to Montreal for spring break so it looks like I'll be a busy beaver for the next few weeks. 


**What will you do next week?**

Projects, projects, studying for this class! Over the next few weeks I'll have 3 mid terms lined up right after another so majority of the week will be spent on studying and working through my school assignments. However, I do plan on to start learning how to bake various types of breads as a side hobby! Stay tuned for more!

**What's my experience of the class?**

The class is definitely getting more challenging as I have to keep track of more Python syntaxes. But I do feel that the things we learn are very relevant and helpful in trying to appreciate what Python ahs to offer. In addition, I'm looking forward to the group project and see what my team and I will be able to accomplish and present at the end!

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
