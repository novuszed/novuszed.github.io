**What did you do this past week?**

This past week I was assigned project 1 for this class along with homework for my quantum information class. I finished project 1 and I'm currenctly struggling through quantum information. I realized how terrible I am in linear algebra but I'm lucky that I have roommates who are willing to help me. Besides that, school has been fine. Wednesday night, my friends and I went out for dinner to send away one of our friends to Europe. And soon, I will be doing some tedious driving back and forth to celebrate Chinese New Year with my family.

**What's in your way?**

Currently, I just have my quantum homework in my way. Besides that, I need to do a lot of reading for my math classes so I don't fall behind. Trying to juggle school and fun will be a challenge this semester. In addition, I'm trying to be more healthy and hope to have time to exercise this week. 

**What will you do next week?**

Next week, I will have to finish my homework and drudge through another week in my classes. It'll basically be a lot of reading and learning outside of class and occasionally go out with friends to enjoy the semester. I hope to go on an adventure next week and explore nature and do something different than I have done before.
 
**What's my experience of the class?**

After working on project 1, I'm beginning to love the class more and more. The entire work flow felt like an actual software development experience and I am glad that I could learn the tools needed. I feel like this class will greatly prepare me for the real world and I can't wait to see what's in stored for me.

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

After struggling through my math classes, I discovered the wonderful tool called Mathematica. Mathematica is a math-centric programming language. It allows you to easily manipulate math and solve equations and provide visualizations.
