**What did you do this past week?**

This week, I struggled through another week of quantum information. Originally I thought my semester would be easy, but looks like now it's going to be one heck of a fight till the summer. This past week, most of what I did involved homework. My roommates and I started cooking more and we expanded our varieties to include baking and new recipes. In addition, after my roommate brought his Wii, I wasted many nights toying with that. Lastly, I attended a programming competition today. While I didn't place in the top 3, I thought I greatly improved since last semester and it has motivated me to code more to get better. 

**What's in your way?**

As usual, quantum homework is in my way. I think the class is very interesting but the homework is difficult, at least for me. Besides that, I have several projects for classes such as this one and my security one that I need to do by next week.

**What will you do next week?**

Next week, I am going to continue trucking on through my classes and I'll also be going to Houston to visit my mom for the weekend to celebrate her birthday. Nothing grand is planned but I do have a music concert tomorrow which I'm pretty excited about! 

**What's my experience of the class?**

Class is still going well for me. We are going more in depth into the syntax of python which I think is very good. I never knew all the nuiances that python had in terms of how it was built and how the variables interact with each other. Netflix project seems fun! It's a bit confusing how it will be tested but if our assumptions are correct then I think we should be fine for the project. I'm curious what the class has in stored whether it'll be more syntax regarding python or something else. The readings for the class are a lot and sometimes I get a bit confused about the material over javascript. Besides that, I'm enjoying it greatly!

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

keep.google.com! It's a simple add on of Google that my roommate recommended to keep track of the list of things you have to do. It has a very easy interface and it can remind you also. The ease of it makes it appealing for people who don't want to write things down each time. I have used it to keep track of the homework I need to do and the groceries I need to buy.
