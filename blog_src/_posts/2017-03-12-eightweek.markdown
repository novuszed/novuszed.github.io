**What did you do this past week?**

This past week I had to take both my exams in intro to security and quantum information on Tuesday. I didn't feel too prepared for these as I had to move one test earlier in order so I could fly out to Canada. Getting back the results for those tests, I wasn't too pleased but such is life and I suppose I'll just have to work harder next time on it. Besides the midterms and studying, I managed to be able to fly to Canada on Friday to enjoy a short personal stay there exploring Montreal. There, I ate lots of good food, experienced lots of the cold weather and overall really enjoyed my stay there. It was a lot of fun and I think it was worth it as a mental break from all the school things that have been happening. Then slowly, I transitioned into finishing up my homework for my classes and familiarizing myself with the project for this class.

**What's in your way?**

A lot of homework. Despite it being spring break, there's still a lot of work that needs to be done and that are due the week when I come back. For instance, my team and I will have to figure out our approach to our project for this class and get everything set up. In addition, I have homework in pretty much every one of my classes that I need to pace myself over the week to try and finish before the break is over. Sadly, it won't really be much of a break but I hope I can make good use of my time to finish the things that will be due soon.

**What will you do next week?**

Homework homework homework! And perhaps learning more about the various frameworks that our project will need like AWS, Flask and front end. It won't be easy but I think I can do it. Then I have to learn various things for my scientific numerical analysis class and finish the homework that has been assigned. In addition, I have to learn more about Markov chains and finish my python homework. So overall, it'll just be a grudgingly slow week of work that must be done. 

**What's my experience of the class?**

Fun fun fun! As we get more into the project, I think I will be able to learn a lot about how the different frameworks work together and how a team in the real world works together to accomplish the various goals. Furthermore, I think we will be able to put the techniques that we've been reading in our assigned reading to work and be able to see our ideas come to life slowly. Learning more about the syntax of Python such as decorators is also fun as I had never been introduced to certain concepts in Python beyond simple scripts. I think the rest of the semester will be challenging but rewarding.
