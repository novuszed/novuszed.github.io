**What did you do this past week?**

This past week I felt more inactive than most weeks. Frankly, I don't even remember what I did for the most part. I know that I worked on Quantum homework and that my group and I spent a lot of time in the lab working on phase 3. A fun thing that I do remember doing was going to Salt Lick with one of my roommates. The restaurant offered more than we had expected. Not only was it a meat heaven, it is decorated and well tendered to. It had lots of flowers and trees surrounding it in addition to music playing by a band along with lots of people chatting and laughing. Other than that, I attended a concert on Monday night. Which is pretty crazy for a Monday night if you ask me.


**What's in your way?**

Quantum homework. This week the homework is mostly based off of quantum algorithms. This means that I have to use my forgotten knowledge from cs331 and apply what I learned to the homework. Other than that, my group and I just need to finalize our phase 3 next week. I think most of it is already done so we shouldn't have much trouble with that.


**What will you do next week?**

Next Saturday is Google Games! My team and I are extremely excited for it. We have our nerdy name and geeky outfits planned out. Should be a fun Saturday filled with challenges and swag. Other than that, I have to register for my classes for next semester. So I'll take a few hours on Monday to plan out my schedule and hope that I get into them without trouble.

**What's my experience of the class?**

SQL was a nice portion of the class. Now coming into refactoring and working on Java, it is a little bit slow and sometimes a bit confusing with all the terms thrown around here and there. The book for refactoring is also extremely dense so it's difficult to follow along with the examples. Working on Phase 3 is pretty fun as we get to see our hard work come together to form this pretty good looking and accessible website.

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

Use an online course planner instead of hand writing out the classes you want to take along with their teams. There are plenty of planners out there and the one I use is Coursicle. It has a very nice interface and it is very easy to use. Only con it has is that it doesn't show any available graduate classes.
